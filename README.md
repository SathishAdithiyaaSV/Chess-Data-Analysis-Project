## Problem Statement


Exploring Chess Rating Patterns Across Major Chess Nations

Chess, a game of strategy and intellect, transcends borders and cultures, captivating minds worldwide. In this project, we aim to delve into the intricate world of chess ratings, focusing on major chess-playing nations such as India, Russia, USA, and China. Our objective is to analyze and visualize the patterns inherent in the chess ratings of these countries, uncovering insights that illuminate the dynamics of their chess scenes.

Analyzing some simple patterns like win rate and visualization of reults from the chess.com games of some prominent players.


## Goal


Data Collection: Gather comprehensive data sets encompassing chess ratings from major chess federations in India, Russia, USA, and China.

Data Analysis: Employ advanced analytical techniques to uncover patterns, trends, and anomalies within the chess ratings data.

Country-wise Comparison: Conduct comparative analyses to identify similarities and differences in rating distributions, growth trajectories, and performance trends among the major chess nations.

Visualization: Develop visually compelling representations of the data, including interactive charts and graphs  to elucidate key findings and facilitate intuitive understanding.



## Features
This project will be able to provide some useful stats from chess.com games and ratings list from fide.com.

## Tech Stack
1.Python<br>
2.Jupyter Notebook<br>
3.VS code<br>
4.Git<br>
## How to run
for Top100Open code a simple run would give all the analysis.

for Chessgamesstats after clicking on run all
the following inputs have to be given:
1.player_name : chess.com username of the player.(eg. MagnusCarlsen, Hikaru)
2.host : the host of the computer on whihc it is running.(eg. if host=raksh then file path=C:\raksh\Downloads\...)
3.year: year in which stats are needed (eg. 2024)
